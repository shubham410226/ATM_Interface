# ATM Interface Program

This project is a Java program that simulates the functionalities of an ATM machine, allowing users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `User.java`: Defines the User class to represent ATM users.
2. `ATM.java`: Defines the ATM class to encapsulate ATM functionalities.
3. `Main.java`: Contains the main method to run the ATM interface program.
4. `ATMInterface.java`: Defines the ATMInterface interface to specify the required functionalities for an ATM.

## Getting Started

To run the ATM interface program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-interface.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or code editor.

3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file to start the ATM interface program.

## Usage

Upon running the program, users will be prompted to enter their user ID and PIN for authentication. Once authenticated, users can select from various options in the menu to perform banking operations.

### Menu Options:

1. **Check Balance**: View the current account balance.
2. **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw funds from the account.
3. **Deposit Money**: Deposit funds into the account.
4. **Exit**: Exit the ATM interface program.

## Testing

The project includes JUnit test scenarios to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities. You can run the tests to verify the behavior of the ATM program under different scenarios.
